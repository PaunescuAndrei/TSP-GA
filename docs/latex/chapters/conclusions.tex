In this paper, I presented my implementation of a solution to the traveling salesman problem using a parallel genetic algorithm. I highlighted the advantages and disadvantages of this type of algorithm and I shared my findings about optimizing such algorithms.

In the end, I achieved better performance by utilizing a parallel algorithm and, despite looking like a small improvement, in the context of genetic algorithms, which are slow and stochastic, it might make the difference between remaining stuck in a local optimum or getting closer to the global one.

Although the program is working perfectly fine, i feel like the speed could be further improved. In the future, I would like to make the following improvements:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Replace some functions of the genetic algorithm with more complex and optimized ones.
    \item Further improve the communication overhead during migration.
    \item Improving the graphical user interface and creating one for the client.
    \item Improve the networking overall between the client and the server.
    \item Optimizing the parameters to obtain better solutions overall.
\end{itemize}
